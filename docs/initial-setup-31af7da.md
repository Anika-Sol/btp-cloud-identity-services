# Initial Setup

Identity Authentication is offered as part of some SAP BTP packages or as a standalone product.

For more information how to get Identity Authentication, see [SAP BTP Pricing and Packaging Options](http://sap.com/products/cloud-platform/pricing.html), or contact your SAP sales representative.

After you purchase a subscription for the Identity Authentication tenant, you receive an e-mail. The e-mail contains a link to the landing page of the administration console for Identity Authentication. You can confirm the registration of your first administrator user.

For more information about the tenant model, tenant licensing, and obtaining a new or additional tenant in Identity Authentication, see [Tenant Model and Licensing](tenant-model-and-licensing-93160eb.md).

> ### Note:  
> If you experience troubles in accessing your Identity Authentication tenant, you can report an incident on [SAP Support Portal Home](https://support.sap.com/en/index.html) with a component `BC-IAM-IDS`.
