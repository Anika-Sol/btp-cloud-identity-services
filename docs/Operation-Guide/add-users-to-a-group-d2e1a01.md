# Add Users to a Group

As a tenant administrator, you can add one or more users created for a specific tenant to a group via the administration console for Identity Authentication.



## Prerequisites

-   You are assigned the *Manage Users* role. For more information about how to assign administrator roles, see [Edit Administrator Authorizations](edit-administrator-authorizations-86ee374.md).

-   You have created user groups in your tenant. For more details how to create user groups, see Related Information.




## Procedure

1.  Access the tenant's administration console for Identity Authentication by using the console's URL.

    > ### Note:  
    > The URL has the following pattern:
    > 
    > `https://<tenant ID>.accounts.ondemand.com/admin`
    > 
    > *Tenant ID* is an automatically generated ID by the system. The first administrator created for the tenant receives an activation e-mail with a URL in it. This URL contains the *tenant ID*. For more information about your tenants, see [Viewing Assigned Tenants and Administrators](../viewing-assigned-tenants-and-administrators-f56e6f2.md).
    > 
    > If you have a configured custom domain, the URL has the following pattern: `<your custom domain>/admin`.

2.  Choose the *User Groups* tile.

    This operation opens a list of the user groups in the tenant.

3.  Choose a group from the list on the left.

    This will show the group details and the users that are added to that group.

4.  Press the *Add* button.

5.  Search for the users or select those from the list that you want to add to the group.

6.  Save your changes.
