As a tenant administrator, you can add one or more users created for a specific tenant to a group via the administration console for SAP Cloud Identity Services.



## Prerequisites

    This will show the group details and the users that are added to that group.

4.  Press the *Add* button.

5.  Search for the users or select those from the list that you want to add to the group.
