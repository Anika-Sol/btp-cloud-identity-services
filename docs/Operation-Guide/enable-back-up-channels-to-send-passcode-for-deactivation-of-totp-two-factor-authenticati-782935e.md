Tenant administrator can configure back-up channels to send TOTP deactivation passcodes to the user.



<a name="loio782935ec3c904178837e96043f2bbc6f__prereq_lrj_kvs_rjb"/>

## Prerequisites

-   You are assigned the *Manage Tenant Configuration* role. For more information about how to assign administrator roles, see [Edit Administrator Authorizations](edit-administrator-authorizations-86ee374.md).

-   \(for the SMS channel\) The user must have a verified phone.

-   \(for the SMS channel\) You have configured the Sinch Service option in the administration console for Identity Authentication. For more information, see [Configure Sinch Service in Administration Console](configure-sinch-service-in-administration-console-f4a04ed.md).

-   \(for the e-mail channel\) The user must have a verified e-mail address.

-   \(for the e-mail channel\) You have configured an e-mail template for the *Deactivate TOTP Device* process. For more information, see [Configuring E-Mail Templates](configuring-e-mail-templates-b2afbcd.md).

    > ### Remember:  
    > The *$\{other.totpResetPasscode\}* parameter is mandatory for the *Deactivate TOTP Device* template.




## Context

The primary channel to deactivate a device is the passcode generated by the mobile device. If no other back-up channel is enabled, this option is the only one for the user in the *Two-Factor Authentication* section of the administration console for Identity Authentication.

When the back-up channels, *SMS* and/or *E-Mail* are enabled in the administration console, the user can choose from the options on the profile page: *TOTP Passcode*, *Passcode via SMS*, and *Passcode via E-Mail*.

> ### Remember:  
> It takes 2 minutes for the configuration changes to take place.

To enable or disable back-up channels for deactivation passcode, follow the procedure below:



## Procedure

1.  Access the tenant's administration console for Identity Authentication by using the console's URL.

    > ### Note:  
    > The URL has the following pattern:
    > 
    > `https://<tenant ID>.accounts.ondemand.com/admin`
    > 
    > *Tenant ID* is an automatically generated ID by the system. The first administrator created for the tenant receives an activation e-mail with a URL in it. This URL contains the *tenant ID*. For more information about your tenants, see [Viewing Assigned Tenants and Administrators](../viewing-assigned-tenants-and-administrators-f56e6f2.md).
    > 
    > If you have a configured custom domain, the URL has the following pattern: `<your custom domain>/admin`.

2.  Under *Applications and Resources*, choose the *Tenant Settings* tile.

    At the top of the page you can view the administrative and license relevant information of the tenant.

3.  Choose the *Multi-Factor Authentication* list item.

4.  Under *TOTP Deactivation Passcode Channels Configuration*, enable or disable the options according to your needs.

    -   *SMS*
    -   *E-Mail*

    If the operation is successful, the system displays the message ***TOTP Deactivation Options updated***.
