# Create a New User Group

As a tenant administrator you can create new user groups in the tenant via the administration console for SAP Cloud Identity Services.



## Prerequisites

You are assigned the *Manage Groups* role. For more information about how to assign administrator roles, see [Edit Administrator Authorizations](edit-administrator-authorizations-86ee374.md).



## Context

> ### Remember:  
> The maximum number of groups assigned to a user is 500.

To create a new user group, proceed as follows:



## Procedure

1.  Sign in to the administration console for SAP Cloud Identity Services.

2.  Choose the *User Groups* tile.

    This operation opens a list of the user groups in the tenant.

3.  Press the *Create* button at the top of the page.

4.  Fill in the required information.

5.  Save your entries.

## Results

If the operation is successful, the system displays the message: `Group "<name of the group>" updated`. Identity Authentication creates the new group and assigns the *Group ID* to it. *Group ID* is in the universally unique identifier \(UUID\) format.
