# Use IdP-Initiated Single Logout \(SLO\)

Use this procedure to start the single logout \(SLO\) process at the identity provider.



## Context

Single Logout \(SLO\) enables users to cleanly close all their sessions in a SAML landscape, even across domains. In the identity provider \(IdP\) initiated SLO, the user initiates a logout request at the identity provider.



## Procedure

1.  Direct the user browser to your SLO endpoint.

    Identity Authentication single logout endpoint follows the template `https://<tenant ID>.accounts.ondemand.com/saml2/idp/slo`

2.  Add the Relay State URL parameter.

    Identity Authentication supports only Relay State. Relay State must be a trusted domain and valid URL.

## Results

After successful logout, the identity provider either redirects the user to the URL provided in the Relay State, or if Relay State isnâ€™t provided, the user is redirected to the profile page.
