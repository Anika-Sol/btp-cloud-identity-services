## Procedure

1.  Access the tenant's administration console for Identity Authentication by using the console's URL.

    > ### Note:  
    > The URL has the following pattern:
    > 
    > `https://<tenant ID>.accounts.ondemand.com/admin`
    > 
    > *Tenant ID* is an automatically generated ID by the system. The first administrator created for the tenant receives an activation e-mail with a URL in it. This URL contains the *tenant ID*. For more information about your tenants, see [Viewing Assigned Tenants and Administrators](../viewing-assigned-tenants-and-administrators-f56e6f2.md).
    > 
    > If you have a configured custom domain, the URL has the following pattern: `<your custom domain>/admin`.

2.  Choose the *Privacy Policy Documents* tile.

    This operation opens a list of the privacy policy documents.

3.  Choose the *\+Add* button on the left-hand panel in order to add a new privacy policy document to the list.

4.  Specify a name for the document.

    > ### Note:  
    > The name can contain only Latin letters, numbers or the underscore character, or a combination of them. The lowercase letters are converted to uppercase letters.

5.  Save your selection

    Once the document has been created, the system displays the message ***Privacy policy document <name of document\> created***.
