# Unassign Groups from a User

As a tenant administrator, you can unassign one or more groups that are assigned to a user via the administration console for Identity Authentication.



## Prerequisites

-   You have created user groups in your tenant. For more details how to create user groups, see Related Information.

-   You have assigned groups to the user. For more details how to assign a group or groups to a user, see Related Information.




## Procedure

1.  Access the tenant's administration console for Identity Authentication by using the console's URL.

    > ### Note:  
    > The URL has the following pattern:
    > 
    > `https://<tenant ID>.accounts.ondemand.com/admin`
    > 
    > *Tenant ID* is an automatically generated ID by the system. The first administrator created for the tenant receives an activation e-mail with a URL in it. This URL contains the *tenant ID*. For more information about your tenants, see [Viewing Assigned Tenants and Administrators](../viewing-assigned-tenants-and-administrators-f56e6f2.md).
    > 
    > If you have a configured custom domain, the URL has the following pattern: `<your custom domain>/admin`.

2.  Choose the *User Management* tile.

    The system displays the first 20 users in the tenant sorted by their user ID number.

3.  Choose the user whose group assignments you want to edit.

4.  Choose *User Groups* tab.

5.  Select the group or groups that you want to unassign.

6.  Press the *Unassign Groups* button at the bottom of the page.

7.  Confirm your changes.
