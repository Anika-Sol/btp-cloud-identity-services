<a name="loio44dd6368b6ed4e9994c45b3eeffac320__prereq_irh_1cs_bdb"/>

## Prerequisites

-   You are assigned the *Manage Corporate Identity Providers* role. For more information about how to assign administrator roles, see [Edit Administrator Authorizations](edit-administrator-authorizations-86ee374.md).

-   You have a configured corporate identity provider. For more information how to configure a corporate identity provider, see [Corporate Identity Providers](corporate-identity-providers-19f3eca.md).




## Context

To choose a corporate identity provider as default, follow the procedures:



## Procedure

1.  Access the tenant's administration console for Identity Authentication by using the console's URL.

    > ### Note:  
    > The URL has the following pattern:
    > 
    > `https://<tenant ID>.accounts.ondemand.com/admin`
    > 
    > *Tenant ID* is an automatically generated ID by the system. The first administrator created for the tenant receives an activation e-mail with a URL in it. This URL contains the *tenant ID*. For more information about your tenants, see [Viewing Assigned Tenants and Administrators](../viewing-assigned-tenants-and-administrators-f56e6f2.md).
    > 
    > If you have a configured custom domain, the URL has the following pattern: `<your custom domain>/admin`.

2.  Under *Applications and Resources*, choose the *Applications* tile.

3.  Choose the application that you want to edit.

    > ### Note:  
    > Type the name of the application in the search field to filter the list items, or choose the application from the list on the left.
    > 
    > If you donâ€™t have a created application in your list, you can create one. For more information, see [Create a New Application](create-a-new-application-0d4b255.md).

4.  Choose the *Trust* tab.

5.  Under the *Conditional Authentication* section, choose the *Conditional Authentication* list item.

6.  Select from the drop down the corporate identity provider that the application will use as the default identity provider.

7.  Save your changes.

    Once the application has been updated, the system displays the message ***Conditional Authentication updated***.
