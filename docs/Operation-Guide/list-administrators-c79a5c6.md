# List Administrators

As a tenant administrator, you can list the administrators and their authorizations in the administration console for Identity Authentication



## Context

To list all administrators, proceed as follows:



## Procedure

1.  Access the tenant's administration console for Identity Authentication by using the console's URL.

    > ### Note:  
    > The URL has the following pattern:
    > 
    > `https://<tenant ID>.accounts.ondemand.com/admin`
    > 
    > *Tenant ID* is an automatically generated ID by the system. The first administrator created for the tenant receives an activation e-mail with a URL in it. This URL contains the *tenant ID*. For more information about your tenants, see [Viewing Assigned Tenants and Administrators](../viewing-assigned-tenants-and-administrators-f56e6f2.md).
    > 
    > If you have a configured custom domain, the URL has the following pattern: `<your custom domain>/admin`.

2.  Choose the *Administrators* tile.

    This operation opens a list of all administrators in alphabetical order.

    > ### Note:  
    > The list also includes the SAP BTP system, which by default has authorizations to set up the trust with Identity Authentication.

3.  Choose the name from the list item to view the profile details, such as user ID and e-mail, and the authorizations assigned to the administrator.

    > ### Tip:  
    > Type the name of the administrator in the search field to filter the list items.
