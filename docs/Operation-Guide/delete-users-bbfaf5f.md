# Delete Users

As a tenant administrator, you can delete users in the administration console.



## Procedure

1.  Sign in to the administration console for SAP Cloud Identity Services.

2.  Choose the *User Management* tile.

    The system displays the first 20 users in the tenant sorted by their user ID number.

3.  Find the user that you want to delete.

    For more information about how to find a user in Identity Authentication, see [Search Users](search-users-06078a6.md).

4.  Select the checkbox next to the user or users that you want to delete.

    You are not allowed to delete your own user profile.

5.  Press *Delete Users*.

6.  Confirm the operation.

    > ### Caution:  
    > If the user you delete is also an administrator, he or she will be removed from the administrator list too. For more information about how to remove and administrator, without deleting it from the user data base, see [Edit Administrator Authorizations](edit-administrator-authorizations-86ee374.md).
