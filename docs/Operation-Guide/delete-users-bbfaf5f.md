# Delete Users

As a tenant administrator, you can delete users in the administration console for Identity Authentication



## Procedure

1.  Access the tenant's administration console for Identity Authentication by using the console's URL.

    > ### Note:  
    > The URL has the following pattern:
    > 
    > `https://<tenant ID>.accounts.ondemand.com/admin`
    > 
    > *Tenant ID* is an automatically generated ID by the system. The first administrator created for the tenant receives an activation e-mail with a URL in it. This URL contains the *tenant ID*. For more information about your tenants, see [Viewing Assigned Tenants and Administrators](../viewing-assigned-tenants-and-administrators-f56e6f2.md).
    > 
    > If you have a configured custom domain, the URL has the following pattern: `<your custom domain>/admin`.

2.  Choose the *User Management* tile.

    The system displays the first 20 users in the tenant sorted by their user ID number.

3.  Find the user that you want to delete.

    For more information about how to find a user in Identity Authentication, see [Search Users](search-users-06078a6.md).

4.  Select the checkbox next to the user or users that you want to delete.

    You are not allowed to delete your own user profile.

5.  Press *Delete Users*.

6.  Confirm the operation.

    > ### Caution:  
    > If the user you delete is also an administrator, he or she will be removed from the administrator list too. For more information about how to remove and administrator, without deleting it from the user data base, see [Edit Administrator Authorizations](edit-administrator-authorizations-86ee374.md).
