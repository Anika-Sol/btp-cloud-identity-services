# Delete User Groups

As a tenant administrator, you can delete one or more user groups in a tenant of Identity Authentication.



## Prerequisites

You are assigned the *Manage Groups* role. For more information about how to assign administrator roles, see [Edit Administrator Authorizations](edit-administrator-authorizations-86ee374.md).



## Context

The delete user groups operation removes user groups and unassigns all users from them.

Follow the procedure below for each group that you want to delete:



<a name="loio9853912732d34ff2b7759b151ad8f27b__steps_dly_pxx_cqb"/>

## Procedure

1.  Access the tenant's administration console for Identity Authentication by using the console's URL.

    > ### Note:  
    > The URL has the following pattern:
    > 
    > `https://<tenant ID>.accounts.ondemand.com/admin`
    > 
    > *Tenant ID* is an automatically generated ID by the system. The first administrator created for the tenant receives an activation e-mail with a URL in it. This URL contains the *tenant ID*. For more information about your tenants, see [Viewing Assigned Tenants and Administrators](../viewing-assigned-tenants-and-administrators-f56e6f2.md).
    > 
    > If you have a configured custom domain, the URL has the following pattern: `<your custom domain>/admin`.

2.  Choose the *User Groups* tile.

    This operation opens a list of the user groups in the tenant.

3.  Select the user group that you want to delete.

4.  Press the *Delete* button in the right-hand panel.

5.  Confirm the operation in the pop-up dialog.

    If the operation is successful, the system displays the message ***Group <group name\> deleted.***.
