# Delete an E-Mail Template Set

Tenant administrators can delete an e-mail template set or a language version for a specific application process.



## Context

You can delete only e-mail template sets that aren’t assigned to applications. If you want to delete an e-mail template that is assigned to an application, first you must choose another e-mail template set for the applications.

You can’t delete the default template set.

If you delete a language version for specific application process, users receive the e-mail from the default template set for this process. If you delete the e-mail template for the self-registration process, for example, users receive the default activation e-mail when they complete the registration.



## Procedure

1.  Sign in to the administration console for SAP Cloud Identity Services.

2.  Choose the *E-Mail Template Sets* tile.

    This operation opens a list of the template sets.

3.  Choose the list item of the template set you want to edit.
