This document is intended to help you configure an OpenID Connect application in the administration console for SAP Cloud Identity Services for the Token Exchange flow.



<a name="copy351866e8cc85482eab310c4ab7a94ff7__prereq_grq_3jn_v2b"/>

## Prerequisites

You have an OpenID Connect application in the administration console for SAP Cloud Identity Services. For more information, see [Create OpenID Connect Application](create-openid-connect-application-62fb1c3.md).



## Context

The trust is configured by entering the information manually. You can enter manually the name of the client \(relying party\), and its redirect URIs.

To configure an OpenID Connect trusted application in the administration console for SAP Cloud Identity Services, proceed as follows:

7.  \(If you added second signing certificate in tenant settings\) Under *Identity Provider Certificate*, choose the certificate to be used.

    > ### Tip:  
    > When the default identity provider certificate is changed with a new one, and the old one is not used anymore, we recommend you to delete the old certificate.

8.  Configure the allowed grant types for the application.

9.  Save your selection. Once the application has been changed, the system displays the message ***Application <name of application\> updated***.

    > ### Remember:  
    > Configure trust on the client side. See the client documentation for more information about how to configure the trust. For more information how to view the OpenID Connect settings of \(For SAML 2.0 Applications\) To log out the user from all active session, when a new password is set, configure the SOAP endpoint. For more information, see Identity Authentication, see [Tenant OpenID Connect Configurations](tenant-openid-connect-configurations-3d6abcc.md).
