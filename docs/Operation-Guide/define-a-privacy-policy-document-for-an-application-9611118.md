# Define a Privacy Policy Document for an Application



## Context

The privacy policy is displayed on the registration form, which form appears when the user chooses the *Register Now* link on the logon page. It is also shown to the user when the registration information has been upgraded. Initially, the application is set to use a default privacy policy on the registration and upgrade forms. To change this configuration, you have to select a custom privacy policy.

If you have the authorization, you can create a custom privacy policy document. This document is used once you have set it for the respective application.



## Procedure

1.  Access the tenant's administration console for Identity Authentication by using the console's URL.

    > ### Note:  
    > The URL has the following pattern:
    > 
    > `https://<tenant ID>.accounts.ondemand.com/admin`
    > 
    > *Tenant ID* is an automatically generated ID by the system. The first administrator created for the tenant receives an activation e-mail with a URL in it. This URL contains the *tenant ID*. For more information about your tenants, see [Viewing Assigned Tenants and Administrators](../viewing-assigned-tenants-and-administrators-f56e6f2.md).
    > 
    > If you have a configured custom domain, the URL has the following pattern: `<your custom domain>/admin`.

2.  Under *Applications and Resources*, choose the *Applications* tile.

3.  Choose the application that you want to edit.

    > ### Note:  
    > Type the name of the application in the search field to filter the list items, or choose the application from the list on the left.
    > 
    > If you donâ€™t have a created application in your list, you can create one. For more information, see [Create a New Application](create-a-new-application-0d4b255.md).

4.  Choose the *Authentication and Access* tab.

5.  Under *POLICIES*, choose *Privacy Policy*.

6.  Select the radio button for the Privacy Policy.

7.  Save your selection.
