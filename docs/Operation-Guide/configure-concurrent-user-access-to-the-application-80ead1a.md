# Configure Concurrent User Access to the Application

Tenant administrator can allow or restrict user access to an application from one or more browsers or devices.



## Context

With the concurrent user access option, you as a tenant administrator can configure the system so that based on the requirements the application can allow or restrict multiple sign-ins by one and the same user.

The concurrent access offers three options:

-   **Allow**

    No restrictions are applied. The user can sign in from multiple devices and browsers. This is the default setting.

-   **Warning**
-   The user can sign in from only one device or browser at a time. If other sessions exist, the user receives a message and will have the option to terminate the other session and sign out.
-   **Error**

    The user can sign in from only one device or browser at a time. When the user try to sign in from another device or browser, they see an error message.




## Procedure

1.  Access the tenant's administration console for Identity Authentication by using the console's URL.

    > ### Note:  
    > The URL has the following pattern:
    > 
    > `https://<tenant ID>.accounts.ondemand.com/admin`
    > 
    > *Tenant ID* is an automatically generated ID by the system. The first administrator created for the tenant receives an activation e-mail with a URL in it. This URL contains the *tenant ID*. For more information about your tenants, see [Viewing Assigned Tenants and Administrators](../viewing-assigned-tenants-and-administrators-f56e6f2.md).
    > 
    > If you have a configured custom domain, the URL has the following pattern: `<your custom domain>/admin`.

2.  Under *Applications and Resources*, choose the *Applications* tile.

3.  Choose the application that you want to edit.

    > ### Note:  
    > Type the name of the application in the search field to filter the list items, or choose the application from the list on the left.
    > 
    > If you donâ€™t have a created application in your list, you can create one. For more information, see [Create a New Application](create-a-new-application-0d4b255.md).

4.  Choose the *Authentication and Access* tab.

5.  Under *AUTHENTICATION*, choose *Concurrent Access*.

6.  Set the radio button for the users you want to allow to log on:

    -   Allow

    -   Warning

    -   Error

    If the application is updated, the system displays the message ***Application <name of application\> updated***.
