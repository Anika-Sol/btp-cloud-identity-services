# Display Application Name on Logon Page

This section shows you how to display or hide the name of the application from the logon page.



## Prerequisites

You are assigned the *Manage Applications* role. For more information about how to assign administrator roles, see [Edit Administrator Authorizations](edit-administrator-authorizations-86ee374.md).



## Context

The application's display name appears on the left side of the logon and registration pages of the applications that use Identity Authentication for authentication. You set this name when you first create your application in the administration console for Identity Authentication, and you can change it later. For more information, see [Create a New Application](create-a-new-application-0d4b255.md) and [Change an Application's Display Name](change-an-application-s-display-name-83d65d0.md).

By default, the display name of the application is set to appear on the logon page.

> ### Caution:  
> Be careful when you switch off the display of the application name. The users might not be sure which application they are providing their credentials for.

> ### Tip:  
> Instead of leaving the left side of the logon page blank you can add an application's logo. For more information, see [Configure a Logo for an Application](configure-a-logo-for-an-application-778f748.md).

To configure the appearance of the application's name on the logon page, proceed as follows:



## Procedure

1.  Access the tenant's administration console for Identity Authentication by using the console's URL.

    > ### Note:  
    > The URL has the following pattern:
    > 
    > `https://<tenant ID>.accounts.ondemand.com/admin`
    > 
    > *Tenant ID* is an automatically generated ID by the system. The first administrator created for the tenant receives an activation e-mail with a URL in it. This URL contains the *tenant ID*. For more information about your tenants, see [Viewing Assigned Tenants and Administrators](../viewing-assigned-tenants-and-administrators-f56e6f2.md).
    > 
    > If you have a configured custom domain, the URL has the following pattern: `<your custom domain>/admin`.

2.  Under *Applications and Resources*, choose the *Applications* tile.

3.  Choose the application that you want to edit.

    > ### Note:  
    > Type the name of the application in the search field to filter the list items, or choose the application from the list on the left.
    > 
    > If you donâ€™t have a created application in your list, you can create one. For more information, see [Create a New Application](create-a-new-application-0d4b255.md).

4.  Choose the *Branding and Layout* tab.

5.  Under *BRANDING*, enable or disable the appearance of the application name on the logon page.

    Once the application has been updated, the system displays the message ***Application <name of application\> updated***.




## Results

Depending on your choice, the display name of the application is visible or hidden on the logon page.
