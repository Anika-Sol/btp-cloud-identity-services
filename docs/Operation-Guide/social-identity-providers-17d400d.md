# Social Identity Providers

By configuring a social provider, users can log on to applications with their social media credentials by linking their accounts in Identity Authentication to the social media account.

Identity Authentication uses the OAuth protocol for social sign-on via one of the following predefined social providers:

-   Apple ID
-   Google
-   Facebook
-   LinkedIn
-   Twitter

Once a user has allowed Identity Authentication to link his or her account with the social provider accounts, the user can log on to applications via these social providers.
