# Add New Version of a Terms of Use Document

Add a new version of a terms of use document and make it active.



<a name="loio2382e1032c10474bad7ed131474f6cf6__context_uqs_f5f_rpb"/>

## Context

To update an existing terms of use document you must add a new version for each language of this document by uploading a UTF-8 encoded plain text file containing the updated terms of use statement. Once the new version is uploaded it is in a status draft. You must activate it to replace the current active version. To make a draft version active, you must have draft versions for all the languages that the current active version has.

## Procedure

1.  Access the tenant's administration console for Identity Authentication by using the console's URL.

    > ### Note:  
    > The URL has the following pattern:
    > 
    > `https://<tenant ID>.accounts.ondemand.com/admin`
    > 
    > *Tenant ID* is an automatically generated ID by the system. The first administrator created for the tenant receives an activation e-mail with a URL in it. This URL contains the *tenant ID*. For more information about your tenants, see [Viewing Assigned Tenants and Administrators](../viewing-assigned-tenants-and-administrators-f56e6f2.md).
    > 
    > If you have a configured custom domain, the URL has the following pattern: `<your custom domain>/admin`.

2.  Choose the *Terms of Use Documents* tile.

    This operation opens a list of the terms of use documents.

3.  To add a new language version to a terms of use document, choose that document from the list on the left.

    > ### Tip:  
    > Type the name of the document in the search field to filter the list items.

4.  Choose the *Add* button in the details view on the top right-hand corner.

    1.  Choose the *Draft Language Version* radio button.

    2.  Select the language from the drop-down for that version.

    3.  Specify the plain text file for the language.

        > ### Note:  
        > Use a file with an extension `.txt`.

    4.  Choose *Add* to save your selection

        Once the file has been uploaded, the system displays the message ***Terms of use file uploaded***.


5.  Repeat the procedure for all languages that have active versions.
