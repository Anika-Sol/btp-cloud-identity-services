# Configuring Provisioning Systems

Configure provisioning systems for synchronizing users and groups between business applications.

Administrators create source, target, and proxy systems, configure properties and transformations when necessary. They manage certificates, update connector versions, schedule and run jobs. Other administrator tasks include enabling or disabling systems as well as exporting and importing them.
