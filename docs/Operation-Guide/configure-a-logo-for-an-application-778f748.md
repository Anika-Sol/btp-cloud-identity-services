# Configure a Logo for an Application

You can configure a custom logo for a specific application by uploading an image. Furthermore, you can remove a configured logo and leave the display name only as a title for the application.

The logo is displayed on the application's logon page and can be included into the e-mails sent to users.



## Procedure

1.  Sign in to the administration console for SAP Cloud Identity Services.

2.  Under *Applications and Resources*, choose the *Applications* tile.

3.  Choose the application that you want to edit.

    > ### Note:  
    > Type the name of the application in the search field to filter the list items, or choose the application from the list on the left.

    > If you donâ€™t have a created application in your list, you can create one. For more information, see [Create a New Application](create-a-new-application-0d4b255.md).

4.  Choose the *Branding and Layout* tab.
