# Administration

The SAP Cloud Identity Services administration and configuration tasks are intended for administrators. They include configuring tenant settings, applications, authorization policies and provisioning, as well as managing users and groups, to ensure proper operations.For these configurations, administrators mainly use the administration console for SAP Cloud Identity Services, a Fiori-based user interface adaptive to most browsers.
