As a tenant administrator, you can view detailed information about the users in the administration console for SAP Cloud Identity Services. Optionally you can edit this information.

## Context

 *User ID* \(P user\) and *Global User ID* \(universally unique identifier \(UUID\) format\) are automatically generated by Identity Authentication at user creation. The `User ID` field is unique and not editable. The *Global User ID*, on the other hand, is unique, but editable. Thus you can use the generated one, or change it with your own one.

By default the *User Type* field is *Employee*. The available user types are: *Customer*, *Employee*, *Partner*, *Public*, *External*, and *Onboardee*.

*Last Name* and *E-Mail* fields are mandatory.

Vaues for *E-Mail*, *First Name* and *Last Name* that are part of the respective exclude list cant' be used. For more information, see [Restrict User Attributes Values via Exclude Lists](restrict-user-attributes-values-via-exclude-lists-cb108c2.md).

*Display Name* can be configured to be mandatory or not. For more information see [Configure User Identifier Attributes](configure-user-identifier-attributes-8b9fa88.md).

*E-Mail* and *Login Name* can be used as unique identifiers. Be sure to enter unique values if you edit these two fields.

Only administrators with *Manage Tenant Configuration* role can edit the *E-Mail* attribute.

*Display Name* can be configured to be unique or not. For more information see [Configure User Identifier Attributes](configure-user-identifier-attributes-8b9fa88.md).

If the check box below the *E-Mail* is selected, the `e-mail` of the user is verified. The tenant administrator can select it manually, to mark the e-mail as verified. For more information about how to require e-mail verification of the user, see, [Enable E-Mail Verification](enable-e-mail-verification-483d26c.md).

If the check box below the *Telephone Verified* is selected, the phone of the user is verified. The tenant administrator can select it manually, to mark the phone as verified.

*User ID*, and *Manager Display Name* fields cannot be edited. They are filled automatically by the system.

The *Valid From* and *Valid To* fields are empty if no validity dates are set for the user.

> ### Remember:  
> When the *Display Name* is set as unique:
> 
> -   If the user is created via the User Registration service of the User Management Rest API, and after successful activation of the user, the display name is generated in the following way: *Display Name* is `first_name` `last_name`.
> 
> -   If there is already another user with the same display name, the *Display Name* is `first_name` `last_name` `user_profile_id`.
> 
> 
> The display name can be changed also by the user via the user profile page.
