# Managing Groups

Tenant administrators can create groups, and assign and unassign these groups to users via the administration console for SAP Cloud Identity Services.



A group is a collection of users. Groups serve to create sets of users who have something in common. For example, users who work in the same department or users who have similar tasks in a company.
