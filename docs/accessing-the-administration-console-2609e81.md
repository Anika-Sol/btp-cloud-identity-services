## Context

> ### Note:  
> When the Identity Authentication tenant is initially provisioned to your organization, only one user is added as a tenant administrator. After that, due to possible legal and security issues, SAP adds additional tenant administrators only in exceptional cases \(for example, the existing administrator left the company, or for some reason there is no active administrator for this tenant\). To avoid access related issues in such cases, it is always a good practice for you to assign more than one administrators. Adding additional ones is exclusively in the responsibility of the current tenant administrators. For more information, see [Add Administrators](Operation-Guide/add-administrators-bbbdbdd.md#loiobbbdbdd3899942ce874f3aae9ba9e21d).

> ### Note:  
> If you experience troubles in accessing your tenant, check our [Guided Answers](https://ga.support.sap.com/dtp/viewer/#/tree/2065/actions/26547:29111:35393:28666:29077:29079:29081:29083) or report an incident on [SAP Support Portal Home](https://support.sap.com/en/index.html) with a component `BC-IAM-IDS`.

## Procedure

1.  Open the SAP Cloud Identity Services tenant URL.

    > ### Note:  
    > The URL has the following pattern:
    > 
    > `https://<tenant ID>.accounts.ondemand.com/admin`
    > 
    > *Tenant ID* is an automatically generated ID by the system. The first administrator created for the tenant receives an activation email with a URL in it. This URL contains the *tenant ID*. For more information about your tenants, see [Viewing Assigned Tenants and Administrators](viewing-assigned-tenants-and-administrators-f56e6f2.md).
    > 
    > If you have a configured custom domain, the URL has the following pattern: `<your custom domain>/admin`.

2.  Sign in to the administration console for SAP Cloud Identity Services.
