# SCIM REST API \(Deprecated\) Authentication Mechanisms

See how to configure the authentication mechanisms for the [SCIM REST API \(Deprecated\)](scim-rest-api-deprecated-2f21568.md) methods of Identity Authentication.

To call the methods of this SCIM REST API you must have a system as administrator with an assigned *Manage Users* role. For more details about how to add a system as administrator and assign administrator roles, see [Add System as Administrator](../Operation-Guide/add-administrators-bbbdbdd.md#loiocefb742a36754b18bbe5c3503ac6d87c), and [Edit Administrator Authorizations](../Operation-Guide/edit-administrator-authorizations-86ee374.md).
