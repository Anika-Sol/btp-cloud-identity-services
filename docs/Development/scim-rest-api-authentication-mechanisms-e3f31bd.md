# SCIM REST API Authentication Mechanisms

See how to configure the authentication mechanisms for the SCIM REST API methods of Identity Authentication.

To call the methods of this SCIM REST API you must have a system as administrator with an assigned *Manage Users* role. For more details about how to add a system as administrator and assign administrator roles, see [Add System as Administrator](../Operation-Guide/add-administrators-bbbdbdd.md#loiocefb742a36754b18bbe5c3503ac6d87c), and [Edit Administrator Authorizations](../Operation-Guide/edit-administrator-authorizations-86ee374.md).
