# SAP Business Ecology Management Bundle

SAP Business Ecology Management \(also known as SAP Sustainability Footprint Management\) bundles with SAP Cloud Identity Services - Identity Authentication and Identity Provisioning.

> ### Note:  
> As of March 15, 2022, Identity Provisioning bundle tenants are created only on the infrastructure of SAP Cloud Identity Services. These tenants come with most of the provisioning systems \(connectors\) enabled by default. Identity Provisioning bundle tenants running on SAP BTP, Neo environment have a limited number of connectors enabled by default. These are illustrated in the diagram that follows.

## How to Obtain

After purchasing the SAP cloud solution that helps customers assess and analyze their environmental impact, the technical contact person of your organization receives two onboarding e-mails from SAP. Each of them provides a tenant URL for accessing the SAP Cloud Identity Services administration console. One of the tenant URLs is for testing purposes, the other one is for productive usage. The technical contact person is granted the administrator permissions of the tenants and performs the initial logon to the SAP Cloud Identity Services administration console.
