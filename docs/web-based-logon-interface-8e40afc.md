# Web-Based Logon Interface

Service providers that delegate authentication to Identity Authentication can use two types of visualization of the web-based user interfaces for the logon pages of their applications.

The two types of visualization of the web-based user interfaces are on a fullscreen of the window and with overlay on top of the application page.



## Overlay

The use of overlays maintains the application context, by keeping the application page as dimmed background, to provide for minimum disturbance to the work flow. The logon page is open in an iframe over the public page of the application.



## Fullscreen

The logon page is displayed on fullscreen in the browser when at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled:

-   the overlay is not integrated in the application
-   the application does not provide a public page
-   the user opens directly a protected page of the application
