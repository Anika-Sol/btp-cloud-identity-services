# Audit Logs

Tenant administrators can access the audit logs for changes in the personal data, and successful, and failed authentications in Identity Authentication.

Identity Authentication runs on several underlying *Infrastructure-as-a-Service* technologies and regions. Some are owned by SAP and some are owned by our partner infrastructure providers, including Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. For more information, see [Regional Availability](../regional-availability-be600ca.md).

Based on the infrastructure the tenant is running on there are two different procedures for accessing the audit logs.

> ### Note:  
> The audit log entries are retained for:
> 
> -   SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry environment \(for tenants on the AWS and Azure infrastructure.\) - 90 days
> -   SAP BTP, Neo environment \(for tenants on the SAP infrastructure\)- 201 days
